## API Integration with Generative Engine

### Model Configuration
```typescript
// Using GPT-4o model via Generative Engine API
model: 'gpt-4o'
endpoint: 'https://api.generative.engine.capgemini.com/v1/chat/completions'
```

### Enhanced Prompts
Analysis type-specific prompts for better results:

#### CSV Analysis
- Data overview with structure analysis
- Statistical insights and calculations
- Pattern identification
- Recommendations based on data trends

#### PDF Analysis
- Document summarization
- Key findings extraction
- Risk assessment
- Strategic recommendations

## Testing Guide

### 1. File Upload Testing
```bash
# Test valid files
- Upload CSV: sample-sales-data.csv
- Upload PDF: Any business document

# Test invalid files
- Try uploading .txt, .docx, .xlsx files (should be rejected)
- Try uploading files > 10MB (should be rejected)
```

### 2. Analysis Type Testing
1. Upload a CSV file
2. Try each analysis type:
   - **Summary**: Should provide overview
   - **Key Points**: Should extract important metrics
   - **Trends**: Should identify patterns
   - **Recommendations**: Should provide actionable advice

### 3. Progress Tracking
1. Upload a large file
2. Watch progress bar during analysis
3. Verify status messages change appropriately

### 4. Export Functionality
1. Complete an analysis
2. Click "Save Results"
3. Verify JSON file downloads with complete data

## Error Scenarios to Test

### 1. API Failures
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid API responses
- Timeout scenarios

### 2. File Processing Errors
- Corrupted PDF files
- Invalid CSV formats
- Empty files

### 3. UI Edge Cases
- Multiple rapid file uploads
- Changing analysis type during processing
- Browser refresh during analysis

## Sample Test Data

### CSV Test Questions
```
- "What are the sales trends over time?"
- "Which products perform best?"
- "Identify any seasonal patterns"
- "What recommendations do you have for improving sales?"
```

### PDF Test Questions
```
- "Summarize the key findings"
- "What are the main risks identified?"
- "Extract the most important metrics"
- "What strategic recommendations are provided?"
```

## Performance Considerations

### File Size Limits
- **Maximum file size**: 10MB
- **Recommended size**: Under 5MB for faster processing
- **Large files**: May take 30-60 seconds to process

### AI Response Times
- **Average response time**: 5-15 seconds
- **Complex analysis**: May take up to 30 seconds
- **Timeout handling**: 60 seconds maximum

## Integration Checklist

- âœ… Generative Engine API configuration
- âœ… GPT-4o model integration
- âœ… Enhanced file handling with react-dropzone
- âœ… Multiple analysis types
- âœ… Progress tracking and feedback
- âœ… Save/export functionality
- âœ… Error handling and fallbacks
- âœ… Responsive design
- âœ… Accessibility features
- âœ… TypeScript type safety

## Next Steps

1. **Test with real documents**: Upload actual business documents and CSV files
2. **Monitor API usage**: Track Generative Engine API calls and costs
3. **Optimize performance**: Improve loading times for large files
4. **Add more analysis types**: Consider adding specialized analysis for specific document types
5. **Enhance export options**: Add PDF, Word, or Excel export formats

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Analysis failed"**: Check API key and network connectivity
2. **"File too large"**: Reduce file size or implement chunking
3. **"Invalid file type"**: Ensure file is PDF or CSV format
4. **Slow analysis**: Large files may take longer to process

### Debug Mode
Enable console logging to see detailed API interactions:
```javascript
console.log('ðŸ¤– AI Service request:', requestData);
console.log('âœ… AI Service response:', responseData);
```
